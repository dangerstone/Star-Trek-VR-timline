# Ideas

## Timeline design
- When you zoom in/out the boxes/blobs/whatever become more granulated/abstract
- Multiple "branches" for parallel timelines
- 


## Implementation Approaches
- Flat timeline, projected onto cylinder (becomes curved)
- Zooming with 2x grip
    - fades into itself or similar when zoomed in
- Dragging with 1x grip
